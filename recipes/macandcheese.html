            <li>ground black pepper</li>
            <li>ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>Mexican oregano</li>
            <li>Minced Garlic Cloves</li>
            <li>diced green peppers</li>
            <li>Sliced Hot Dogs</li>
            <li>crushed tomatoes </li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>green onions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add olive oil to a large pot and place over high heat. Add beef; cook and stir, breaking up with a spoon or spatula, about 2 minutes. Add onions and salt, and cook, stirring, until beef is crumbly, and onions turn translucent, about 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Add the chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, cinnamon, cayenne, dried oregano, and garlic. Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes. </li>
            <li>Add peppers, sliced hot dogs, crushed tomatoes, and water. Stir together; bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked to your taste, at least 30 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning. </li>
            <li>Once chili is nearly ready, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, 1 minute less than specified in package directions, until not quite tender, and still firm to the bite, about 8 to 11 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Turn off heat under chili, drain macaroni, and add to the pot of chili. Stir until combined, and transfer mixture into a large, deep (15x10-inch) baking dish. </li>
            <li>Mix Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses together in a bowl, and transfer about 60% of cheese to top of chili mixture. Use a spoon to thoroughly mix cheese into the casserole.</li>
            <li>Apply remaining cheese evenly over the top, and lightly poke down into the surface with the tip of a spoon.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Let rest 15 minutes before serving, topped with green onions.</li>
        </ol>
